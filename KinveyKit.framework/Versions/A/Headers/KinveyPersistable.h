This protocol is used to inform that this object is able to be saved to the Kinvey Cloud Service.  The methods
defined in this protocol are used to determine what data to save and then to actually save the data.

The KCSEntity category on NSObject conforms to this protocol, providing a default implementation of this protocol
for all NSObject descendants.  You may directly implement this protocol in order to provide actions not accomplished by
the default methods provided.  See method documentation for important information about restrictions on clients when
implementing these methods.
 
 @bug Only hostToKinveyPropertyMapping should be implemented by the library user, the implementation provided by the KCSEntity category
 should be used for all other methods.

 - KCS_DICTIONARY_NAME_KEY -- The name of the Instance Variable that is the dictionary to map.
 
 If KCS_USE_DICTIONARY_KEY is set to an NSNumber representing YES then KinveyKit will look for at the value for KCS_DICTIONARY_NAME_KEY.
 It will then look in your object for a property whos name is this value and is of type NSDictionary.  It will store all Key-Value pairs
 in this dictionary to the collection on the backend as individual properties (eg, the dictionary is not stored, but the key-values end
 up stored as property-values in Kinvey).  When fetching from Kinvey any properties that are not in the mapping function are placed
 as key-values into this dictionary.
